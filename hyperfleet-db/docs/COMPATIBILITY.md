# Controller-Runtime Compatibility

`pgruntime.NewManager()` returns a standard `manager.Manager` backed by PostgreSQL instead of kube-apiserver + etcd.

## What works

The standard reconciler pattern works unchanged:

- `For()`, `Owns()`, `Watches()` with all standard predicates (`GenerationChanged`, `LabelChanged`, `AnnotationChanged`, `ResourceVersionChanged`)
- `MaxConcurrentReconciles`
- `client.Get()`, `client.List()` with `InNamespace`, `MatchingLabels`, `MatchingFields`, `Limit` / `Continue`
- `Create()`, `Update()`, `Delete()`, `Status().Update()`
- Finalizers, labels, annotations
- Generation tracking
- Optimistic concurrency via `ResourceVersion` (409 Conflict on stale writes)
- Health and readiness checks
- `apierrors.IsNotFound()` / `IsConflict()` / `IsAlreadyExists()`

Your CRD types must have exported fields named exactly `Spec` and `Status` (found by reflection). Both the type and its `List` type must be registered in the scheme.

## What's different

These features work but behave differently from standard controller-runtime against kube-apiserver:

| What                              | Standard kube                                           | pgruntime                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Read consistency                  | `GetClient()` reads from cache — can be seconds stale   | `GetClient()` reads from DB — always current                                                                                   |
| No-op writes                      | May or may not bump `ResourceVersion`                   | Content-equal writes suppressed: no version bump, no event                                                                     |
| Delete lifecycle                  | Object removed immediately after finalizers clear       | Tombstone row persists until compaction (24h default). Invisible to callers — `Get()` returns NotFound, `List()` excludes them |
| Horizontal scaling                | Leader election (1 active replica) or external sharding | Multiple replicas via hash sharding (`Options.Shard`, keyed by namespace or `KeyLabel`); direct client always sees full dataset                        |
| Event delivery                    | HTTP/2 streaming watch                                  | Poll (5s baseline) with `pg_notify` doorbell (~100ms typical delivery)                                                         |
| `GetAPIReader()` vs `GetClient()` | Different: uncached vs cached reads                     | Identical: both go to DB                                                                                                       |
| Periodic resync                   | Informers re-list every 10h to catch missed events      | No resync — poll-based watch can't miss events within the compaction window                                                    |
| `IndexField()`                    | Registers cache indexes used by field selectors         | No-op — accepted but ignored. `MatchingFields` queries the database directly                                                   |
| Label / field selectors           | Evaluated by the apiserver                              | Translated to SQL. Label selectors use a GIN index; `metadata.name`/`namespace`/`uid` hit columns; `spec`/`status` paths scan JSON |
| Cluster-scoped resources          | RESTMapper marks types as cluster-scoped; empty ns      | Works with empty namespace                                                                                                     |

### Sharding specifics

When `Options.Shard` is set, the cache's informer List/Watch queries include a field-selector-like restriction (`hashtext(key) % Mod = ANY(Owned)`). The key is the namespace, or with `KeyLabel` set, that label's value falling back to the row's own uid, so an owner and the objects carrying its uid in the label share a replica. A `KeyLabel` value must be set at create and never changed: a watcher does not see an object move out of its shard. The informer cache only contains the replica's owned rows. The direct client (`GetClient()`, `GetAPIReader()`) is never restricted — it always queries the full dataset.

`UnshardedGVKs` exempts specific GVKs from the shard predicate so every replica watches them fully. Use this for cluster-scoped or shared configuration resources.

**PostgreSQL version caveat:** `hashtext()` return values may change across PostgreSQL major versions. A major-version upgrade reshuffles all shard assignments. This is benign — all replicas restart during a major upgrade, and the transient period of overlapping watches resolves after the rolling restart. No data is lost; the only effect is a burst of duplicate reconciles.

## What's not supported

These features return an error, panic, or are not available. If you're porting an existing controller, check for these.

## What fails silently

These are the features that accept input without error but don't behave as expected. If you're porting a controller that relies on these, you'll get wrong behavior with no warning.
