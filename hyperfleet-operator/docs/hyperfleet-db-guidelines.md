# hyperfleet-db Development Guidelines

Rules for any code that stores or reconciles HyperFleet resources through hyperfleet-db:
platform-api, the operator, and anything new. New and reviewed code follows them.

## The rules

1. **Namespace is the account.** `account-<id>`. Nothing else is encoded in it.
   Internal namespaces (e.g. `Index` scopes) are operator-only; clients can't reach
   them.
2. **Name is for humans.** Chosen by the client and never changed. A child of a
   cluster is named `<cluster>.<child>`.
3. **UID is for machines.** Minted by the database. Every stored reference uses the
   uid, never the name.
4. **Owned objects carry an ownerReference and the `hyperfleet.io/cluster-uid`
   label.** Claims (`Index`, `OidcConfig`, `DnsReservation`) carry their holder's uid
   in a label instead.
5. **Every controller cleans up what it created.** Its finalizer deletes and releases
   it; anything left behind is a bug.
6. **Uniqueness comes from the name, or from an `Index` claim.**
7. **Business rules live in code, not in the database.** No new constraints and no
   special query paths.
8. **Reconcilers are idempotent.** There are no cross-object transactions, so the
   system converges through retries.

## 1. What hyperfleet-db is

A controller-runtime client and cache backed by Postgres. It looks like Kubernetes, but
it is **not an apiserver**. Know the differences:

| You might expect…                     | In hyperfleet-db                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| admission / CRD schema validation     | **none**. CEL and OpenAPI markers enforce nothing; validate in platform-api      |
| a cached, possibly stale `Get`/`List` | **always a Postgres query**. Never stale, but not free: don't call it in loops   |
| `Patch`, `DeleteAllOf`, `GenerateName`, `DryRun` | **not supported**. Use `Get` + `Update`, and set names explicitly     |
| Kubernetes garbage collection         | **none**. Each controller cleans up what it created ([§6](#6-ownership-and-cleanup)) |
| unique fields beyond the name         | **only the primary key** `(kind, namespace, name)`. Use an `Index` ([§7](#7-uniqueness)) |
| transactions across objects           | **none**. Each write is one row; converge in reconcile                           |

What works as usual:

- **Updates are optimistic.** A stale `resourceVersion` gets `Conflict`: get the object
  again and retry (`retry.RetryOnConflict`). Status is a separate write
  (`Status().Update`).
- **Writes that change nothing are skipped.** They don't bump the version or wake
  watchers, so writing desired state every reconcile is cheap.
- **Label selectors** are backed by SQL. **Field selectors** on `metadata.name`,
  `metadata.namespace`, and `metadata.uid` hit columns. Selectors on `spec`/`status`
  paths scan JSON, so keep them off hot paths.
- **Delete** sets a deletion timestamp while finalizers remain. After that the row is a
  tombstone, and creating the same name again makes a **new object with a new uid**.

## 2. Identity

```yaml
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  namespace: account-123456789012
  name: typeidhcp
  uid: 4610b27e-8f77-4f4c-9661-c11b42e04dec   # the cluster ID
---
kind: NodePool
metadata:
  namespace: account-123456789012
  name: typeidhcp.workers
  uid: 9c2f5e1a-1b2c-4d3e-8f90-a1b2c3d4e5f6
  labels:
    hyperfleet.io/cluster-uid: 4610b27e-8f77-4f4c-9661-c11b42e04dec
  ownerReferences:
    - apiVersion: hyperfleet.io/v1alpha1
      kind: Cluster
      name: typeidhcp
      uid: 4610b27e-8f77-4f4c-9661-c11b42e04dec
      controller: true
```

| Field                       | Set by                  | Rule                                                          |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `namespace`                 | client                  | must be `account-<caller's account>`, else 403                |
| `name`                      | client                  | see [Names](#3-names); unique per kind and namespace; immutable |
| `uid`                       | database                | client value ignored; immutable                               |
| `ownerReferences`           | platform-api / operator | client value ignored; immutable                               |
| `hyperfleet.io/*` labels    | platform-api / operator | client value ignored; kept on every update                    |
| `annotations`               | client                  | free-form; stored as-is; key format and size are validated    |

The caller's account comes from API Gateway, which sets `X-Amz-Account-Id` from the
SigV4-verified identity. It never comes from the request body. platform-api stores
objects unchanged, but it validates them first.

## 3. Names

| Object                           | Name format         | Example             |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Cluster                          | `<cluster>`         | `typeidhcp`         |
| Child of a cluster (NodePool, …) | `<cluster>.<child>` | `typeidhcp.workers` |

- **Each part is a DNS label:** lowercase letters, digits, and `-`, starting and ending
  with a letter or digit, and **no dots**. `<cluster>` is at most 18 characters,
  because HyperShift builds `cluster-<uid>-<cluster>` from it (longer names can come
  later as an alias). `<child>` is at most 63.
- **The dot makes child names collision-free.** Neither part contains a dot, so
  `cluster-test.np` and `cluster.test-np` stay distinct. With `-` as the joiner, both
  would be `cluster-test-np`.
- **The client sends the full name.** platform-api checks it, but never rewrites it. The
  SDK has a helper that builds it.
- **On the management cluster**, a cluster's objects live in its namespace
  `cluster-<uid>` under plain names (`workers`, `pull-secret`).
- `<cluster>.<child>` is the **only** name ever built from other names.

## 4. References and lookups

Names can be reused after a delete, but uids can't. Anything that points at another
object stores its **uid**.

| To…                                | Use                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| record an object's owner           | an `ownerReference` **and** the `hyperfleet.io/cluster-uid` label       |
| list a cluster's objects           | label selector on `hyperfleet.io/cluster-uid` (not `InNamespace`)     |
| react to changes in owned objects  | `Owns(&NodePool{})`                                                   |
| hold an `Index` claim              | label `hyperfleet.io/owner-uid` ([§7](#7-uniqueness))                 |
| claim an account object (`OidcConfig`, `DnsReservation`) | label `hyperfleet.io/claimed-by-cluster-uid` (mutable: released and re-taken) |

The ownerReference and the label are set once, at create, from the same parent, so they
can't drift apart. Both are needed because an ownerReference can't be used in a label
selector or the shard key.

**Lookups:**

- **By name:** `GET /clusters/typeidhcp`.
- **By uid:** `GET /clusters?fieldSelector=metadata.uid=<uid>`.
- **Holding both** (e.g. an ownerReference): get by name, then compare the uid. A
  different uid means the name was reused, and the object you meant is gone.
- **Never key cached state by name alone.** A delete followed by a create can reach a
  watcher as a single "update" whose uid changed.

## 5. Lifecycle

- **Create:** the client sends namespace and name. The database mints the uid and
  returns it. A duplicate name gets 409.
- **Create a child:** platform-api gets the parent (404 if it is missing, 409 if it is
  being deleted), sets the ownerReference and label, then inserts.
- **Use an account object:** things a cluster needs before it exists (`OidcConfig`, and
  `DnsReservation` so a shared-VPC hosted zone can be made for its domain) are
  top-level objects the client creates first. The cluster references one by uid;
  platform-api checks it is ready and unclaimed, then sets
  `hyperfleet.io/claimed-by-cluster-uid` (409 if another cluster holds it). When the
  client passes none, platform-api creates one as the cluster's child.
- **Update:** spec and annotations only. Identity, ownerReferences, and labels never
  change.
- **Delete:** by name. The owner's finalizer deletes its children and finishes once
  they are gone.

## 6. Ownership and cleanup

Every controller cleans up what it created, in its finalizer. Anything left behind is
a bug. For a cluster, that means deleting its children (listed by its
`hyperfleet.io/cluster-uid` label), waiting until they are gone, and releasing its
claims (`Index`, `OidcConfig`, `DnsReservation`). Each
child's own finalizer tears down what that child created. Released account objects
stay for a later cluster.

### Known gaps: no garbage collector

Kubernetes has a garbage collector that deletes any object whose ownerReference points
at an owner that is gone. hyperfleet-db doesn't have one: ownerReferences are stored
and drive `Owns()` watches, but nothing deletes an object because of them. Finalizers
cover normal deletes. What we lose:

- **The create-during-delete race.** A child inserted just after its owner's finalizer
  last found nothing is never deleted. platform-api returns 409 for a parent that is
  being deleted, but the parent's deletion can still start between that check and
  the insert. Kubernetes would delete the orphan.
- **A safety net for bugs.** If a finalizer misses something, or a finalizer is removed
  by hand, children stay forever. Kubernetes would still clean them up.
- **Propagation policies.** A delete with `PropagationPolicy` (`Foreground`,
  `Background`, `Orphan`) is rejected, and `blockOwnerDeletion` does nothing. Every
  delete runs through the owner's finalizer.

Orphans don't break correctness. Uids are never reused, so a recreated cluster never
picks up the old cluster's children. They just leak: rows stay, and a child's
reconciler may keep retrying against a management-cluster namespace that's gone.

## 7. Uniqueness

| Unique within…          | Tool                   | Example                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| one kind in one account | the name (primary key) | only one cluster `typeidhcp` in the account                    |
| any wider scope         | an `Index` claim       | DNS prefix `f7a3` in shard 0; an OIDC issuer URL in the region |

An `Index` is an empty object. Its namespace is the scope and its name is the value.
The primary key allows one per (scope, value), so **creating it is the claim**.

```yaml
kind: Index
metadata:
  namespace: dns-shard-0-reservations   # the scope
  name: f7a3                 # the claimed value
  labels:
    hyperfleet.io/owner-uid: 2b8e0c4d-5a6f-4e7b-9c1d-3e4f5a6b7c8d   # the DnsReservation
spec: {}
```

- **Claim:** create it. On `AlreadyExists`, get it. If `owner-uid` is yours, you already
  hold it (retries are safe). Otherwise it's taken: pick another value or report a
  conflict.
- **Values that aren't valid names** (e.g. URLs): normalize, then hash
  (`IssuerURLIndexName`).
- **Keep the data on the owner** (e.g. `dnsReservation.status.baseDomain`). The Index
  is only the lock; don't add a second object.
- **Release:** the owner's finalizer deletes Indexes carrying its uid, and never ones
  carrying someone else's.

**Why Index.** It relies on the one guarantee fleetdb already has, so a new uniqueness
rule needs no migration. A per-rule DB constraint would put business rules in the
schema. Checking in platform-api (list, then insert) is not atomic. A generic
unique-keys table written in the same transaction as the owner would release keys
automatically, but it adds new write behavior to fleetdb; revisit it only if
uniqueness rules multiply.

## 8. Sharding

Each operator replica reconciles one slice of the rows, keyed by the owning cluster's
uid (or the row's own uid if it has no owner). The operator sets
`ShardConfig.KeyLabel` to `hyperfleet.io/cluster-uid`, which makes hyperfleet-db use:

```sql
abs(hashtext(COALESCE(metadata->'labels'->>'hyperfleet.io/cluster-uid', uid::text))::bigint) % $mod = ANY($owned)
```

**Why.** Reconcile work (AWS and management-cluster calls, retries, rate limits) grows
with the fleet. Sharding spreads it across replicas and limits the blast radius of one
bad pod. Keying by cluster keeps a cluster and all its objects on one replica, so no
cluster is ever reconciled in two places. Only watches and reconciles are sharded;
reads always see every row. Today it runs as one shard, and scaling out is a config
change (`REPLICA_COUNT`). Details, limits, and the path to lease-based failover are in
[sharding.md](sharding.md).

**What it means for your code:**

- **Carry the label.** An object whose watch triggers a cluster reconcile must carry
  that cluster's `hyperfleet.io/cluster-uid`. Otherwise its events go to the wrong
  replica.
- **Be idempotent.** While the replica count changes, a cluster can briefly be
  reconciled by two pods.
- **No decisions from local counts across clusters.** For something like placing onto
  a management cluster with limited capacity, claim with an `Index` or use an
  optimistic update on a shared object.

## Review checklist

- [ ] References another object? It stores the **uid**.
- [ ] Belongs to a cluster? **ownerReference + `hyperfleet.io/cluster-uid`**.
- [ ] Lists a cluster's objects? The **label**, not `InNamespace`.
- [ ] Builds a name? Only `<cluster>.<child>`.
- [ ] Per-cluster object on the management cluster? In **`cluster-<uid>`**, plain name.
- [ ] Something unique beyond the name? One **`Index`**, value stored on the owner.
- [ ] Needed before the cluster exists (like DNS)? A **top-level account object** the cluster claims.
- [ ] Validation? In **platform-api**; CRD markers aren't enforced.
- [ ] Update? **Retries on conflict**; no `Patch`.
- [ ] Reconciler safe to run twice? No **local counts** for cross-cluster decisions.
- [ ] New database constraint or special query? Use code instead.
